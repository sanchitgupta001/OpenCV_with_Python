# OpenCV_with_Python
This repository contains basic functions which can be done using OpenCV with Python3.

Clone this repository using : git clone https://github.com/sanchitgupta001/OpenCV_with_Python

cd OpenCV_with_Python

Install all the required libraries using : sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt (for Python3)

For the ones who are working on Windows, I would recommend using Anaconda software compatible with Python3.

That's It..... Any errors or suggestions are always welcomed.....
